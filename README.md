Here are some of the SQL queries that I wrote for a data analysis project using COVID-19 data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-death. 
These queries demonstrate my ability to use aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, and to problem solve when problems with data sets arise. 
After writing these queries, I imported the data into Tableau where I created a dashboard in order to neatly visualize the information.
